House Price Prediction - Machine Learning Project 
This project predicts house prices using linear regression. The model is trained using separate training and testing datasets to evaluate performance accurately.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES 
1) Perform Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
2) Clean and preprocess the dataset
3) Train a Linear Regression model
4) Evaluate Model performance
5) Predict house price based on features.

DATASET DEATILS
Training Dataset:
Used to train machine learning model
Testing Dataset:
Used to evaluate model accuracy

Features(X)
Common Features may include:
House area
Lot size
Floors
etc.

Target(Y)
House Sale Price

Machine Learning Model Used:
LINEAR REGRESSION

STEPS PERFORMED
1. Imported Libraries (Pandas, Numpy , Seaborn , Sklearn ,Matplotlib)
2. Loadede training and testing datasets
3. Used EDA to understand dtaa distribution
4. Handled missing values
5. Visualized correlations
6. Split data into train/test
7. Trained linear regression model
8. Evaluated using R2 Score and RMSE
9. Predicted House price

Result
R2 Score(0.6557)
RMSE(35K)
11.
